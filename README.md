database schema


Most people are familiar with MySQL, which is the most popular open source database. But for me, Postgres is my main choice, because it can handle spatial data and in conjunction with QGIS, an open source GIS.

This folder contains my databases schema. The first one is the Earthquake.sql. The Earthquake.sql database was created from the earthquake data obtain from the book SQL for Data Analysis: Advance Techniques for Transforming Data Insights by Cathy Tanimura (link to earthquakes csv files:Â https://github.com/cathytanimura/sql_book).

Use to it create the database and then go to the link above  to acquire the data for the database.

I am planning to update the earthquake schema in near the future, but you can use it for sql practice or other project. Alternatively, You can use the earthquake csv files in R or python for your data analysis, but they are huge (more than 1,000,00 and it make sense load them into database. If you have trouble with the database, just email me.
